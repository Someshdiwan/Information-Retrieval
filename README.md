## üöÄ Overview

This repository showcases several fundamental and advanced techniques in **text document processing** and **information retrieval (IR)**, including methods for text classification, vector space modeling, similarity computation, and web crawling.

### Key Techniques:

- **Text Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Vector Space Model (VSM)**: Representing documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space for processing.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Computing the similarity between documents using the cosine similarity measure.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Text classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm (GaussianNB).
- **Web Crawling**: Crawling websites to extract news stories with domain filtering.
