    "Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "URL Management: The function crawl_webpage() takes an initial URL, max_depth (maximum depth to crawl), and allowed_domains (optional list of domains to restrict crawling).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetching Web Pages: The requests.get(current_url) function fetches the webpage, and BeautifulSoup parses the HTML to extract links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Link Filtering: The urlparse function is used to extract the domain from the URL to ensure we only crawl links within the allowed domains (if provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "Crawl Depth: The crawling process continues to the next level by appending the link to urls_to_visit until the maximum depth is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "User Input: You can modify the code to take user input for the search term (e.g., news topic) and filter links based on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Storage: For a real-world application, you would typically store the crawled data (like news articles) into a database or \n",
    "file system for further processing (e.g., sentiment analysis or topic classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Web crawling refers to the process of automatically navigating the web and collecting information from websites. \n",
    "This technique is essential for search engines, data extraction, and many other applications where automated access to the internet is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to gathering news stories on a specific topic, the process typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Crawling: Using an automated crawler to visit websites and extract news articles based on the given topic.\n",
    "HTML Parsing: Extracting relevant content (e.g., headlines, articles) from the HTML structure of the pages using a parser.\n",
    "Filtering: Allowing the user to limit the crawl to specific websites or domains. \n",
    "This is particularly important when focusing on collecting news from trusted sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing Results: Saving the collected news stories for further processing, analysis, or display.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment, we use the Python libraries requests and BeautifulSoup for crawling and parsing HTML content. \n",
    "requests allows us to fetch the content from URLs, while BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTML content and extract useful information."
